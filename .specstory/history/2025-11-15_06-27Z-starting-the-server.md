**Setting up server execution**

I need to check the content of start-server.sh to see how to run it. I think I should start with a read_file call first. The batch will include three actions: manage_todo_list, read_file, and then run_in_terminal for start-server.sh. Since this might be a long-running process, I'll set isBackground to true. That way, it won't block, but I can later use get_terminal_output tool to present the output if needed.**Implementing server tasks**

I believe I should start the server in the background and then fetch the output after a short delay. The get_terminal_output requires the terminal ID returned from run_in_terminal, so I'll capture that. I'll prepare the manage_todo_list with two tasks: creating a todo list and running the server. I must mark one task as in-progress before starting and then complete it afterward. There will be two calls to manage_todo_list — first for the initial list and then to update the status post-server start.**Running server setup**

Next, I need to run read_file and then execute run_in_terminal. The sequence will include a brief explanation first. I’ll call manage_todo
